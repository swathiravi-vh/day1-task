1.deffernce bettween http 1.1 vs http2?

Http 1.1:
*It supports connection reuseUses 
*Introduces a warning header field to carry additional information about the status of a message
*Expands on the caching support by using additional headers like cache-control, conditional headers like If-Match and by using entity tags.
Http2:
*Uses multiplexing
*Underlying semantics of HTTP such as headers, status codes remains the same.
*does not change much in terms of caching
